		<h2>An analysis of key themes in 10 Day, Acid Rap, and Coloring Book</h2>
		<h5>In just a few years, Chance the Rapper has gone from a normal high school student to an international celebrity. Recently he became the first independent artist to win a Grammy Award, with  <i>Coloring Book</i> winning 2017 Rap Album of the Year.</h5>
		<h5>Chance has been through a lot since his first album was released, from a taxing drug addiction to the birth of his daughter. As he has grown as an artist and as a person, the themes of his albums have changed substantially over time. This project highlights some of the major themes of his three major mixtapes.</h5>
		<h5>The <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/157xrJnW1FhTa95tYlG6uUJW2P8JdrL8l59ZqXwQevSw/edit?usp=sharing">data</a> was gathered with my own Python program, the <a href="https://github.com/sickandhungry/chano-meter/blob/master/chano-meter.py"> Chano-meter</a>, which automatically counts the occurences of any given word in each of Chance's songs. The charts were created in Python with <a href="http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/">Bokeh</a>. Dot size is relative; charts are be scaled to appear as large as possible. Color differences are purely aesthetic.</h5>

               <p>10 Day was Chance's first full-length mixtape. The songs were written during Chance's final days high school, while he was serving on a 10-day suspension for possessing marijuana on campus. After writing the songs of <i>10 Day</i>, Chance dropped out of school to begin working on the album full-time. One line explains, "Fun fact: I'm never going back to school. Been there, done that." </p>
               <p>In 10 Day, Chance raps about his transition from everyday student to local celebrity. In <i>Long Time Part II</i>, he sings, "Things ain’t been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous." In <i>Prom Night</i>, he rapped about missing events like prom and graduation, and listening to teachers sneer at his musical dreams: "You made a mixtape? Good job, I hope you get a good job." At this point, Chance had a lot to prove to his teachers, family, peers. </p>
               <p> This album detailed Chance's life on the South Side of Chicago, with references to money, cops, and guns. However, it didn't portray the gangster lifestyle in a very positive light; in <i>Missing You</i>, Chance raps, "Brown boys are dying and none of 'em were for business, and, all of 'em love they mamas and all of they mamas miss 'em." This was the beginning of Chance's long fight against violence in the streets of Chicago. More than anything, this was an album full of hope, for Chance's future as well as his city's.</p>

               <p>Acid Rap was the album that jolted Chance into international fame; it was ranked 12 on <i>Pitchfork's</i> Top 50 Albums of 2013 and nominated for Best Mixtape at the 2013 BET Hip Hop Awards. Acid Rap was the genre-bender that put alternative hip hop on the map; Pitchfork wrote, "it invites elements of classic soul, juke, gospel, blues-rock, drill, acid jazz, house, ragtime scat, and R. Kelly, Twista, and a young Kanye to the same open mic poetry night, where the kid on-stage is declaiming about what’s going unreported."</p>
		<p>On the surface, Acid Rap was an album about sex and drugs. Acid is mentioned 26 times on the album, in six different songs. The album's biggest hit <i>Cocoa Butter Kisses</i> mentions cigarettes, absinthe, peyote, weed, codeine, methamphetamine all within five minutes, with a line about putting "Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me" and a chorus ending with "I think we all addicted."</p>
	<p>However, Acid Rap was more than meets the eye. On <i>Acid Rain</i>, the verse that begins with "kicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain, wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane" ends with "My big homie died young; just turned older than him. I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always. He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways." <i>Paranoia</i> builds on this theme, with the lines, "They murking kids, they murder kids here. Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here."</i></p>
	<p>Acid Rap is an album of pain - depression, addiction, and loss - juxtaposed with love. <i>That's Love</i> exclaims, "What's better than tripping, is falling in love. What's better than followers, is actually falling in love. What's better than rhymes, nickles, dimes, dollars, and dubs, is dialing up your darling just for calling her up. There ain't nothing better than falling in love." This juxtaposition is what makes the album so powerful - <i>Acid Rap</i> reminds us that no matter how bad things get, there's always love.</i>
